## Statement

This project aims to develop models that predict CO2 emissions levels (Low or High) for vehicles based on specific attributes. The dataset contains information on $1067$ vehicles with the following attributes: engine size, number of cylinders, fuel consumption in urban areas, and fuel consumption on highways. To perform the prediction, two machine learning techniques will be implemented: **neural networks** and **decision trees**.
